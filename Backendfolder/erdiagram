## 📌 Project Overview 

**Project Title:** Classroom Attention & Feedback Analyzer (Ethical)

This project is a web-based system designed to help teachers understand students’ learning levels without identifying individual students. The system allows students to submit real-time or post-class feedback about how well they understood a topic. The collected feedback is analyzed in aggregate form to show trends and overall understanding.

The main goal of the project is to improve teaching effectiveness while maintaining student privacy. Teachers can adapt their teaching methods based on class-level insights instead of focusing on individual students. The system follows ethical principles by keeping feedback anonymous and showing only summarized results.

The application is built using a MERN-style architecture:

* **React** for the frontend user interface
* **Node.js & Express.js** for backend APIs
* **MySQL** as the relational database for structured and secure data storage

---

## 🎯 Key Features (Short)

* Students give anonymous feedback
* Teachers view class-level understanding trends
* No student is singled out
* Ethical and privacy-focused design
* Scalable and structured backend database

## 🗄️ Database Overview (With Comment Lines)

Below is the **database explanation written as comment lines**, exactly how teachers like to see it:

```sql
-- Teachers table stores information about instructors
-- Each teacher can teach multiple classes
TABLE teachers (
    teacher_id PRIMARY KEY,
    name,
    email
);

-- Students table stores student information
-- Student identity is not linked to feedback to ensure anonymity
TABLE students (
    student_id PRIMARY KEY,
    name,
    email
);

-- Classes table represents individual classes or subjects
-- Each class is associated with one teacher
TABLE classes (
    class_id PRIMARY KEY,
    class_name,
    subject,
    teacher_id FOREIGN KEY
);

-- Class_enrollments table manages many-to-many relationship
-- It shows which students are enrolled in which classes
TABLE class_enrollments (
    enrollment_id PRIMARY KEY,
    class_id FOREIGN KEY,
    student_id FOREIGN KEY
);

-- Feedback table stores anonymous feedback for each class
-- No student_id is stored to maintain ethical privacy
TABLE feedback (
    feedback_id PRIMARY KEY,
    class_id FOREIGN KEY,
    understanding_level,
    comments,
    feedback_time
);

-- Understanding_summary table stores analyzed results
-- It contains average understanding and total responses per class
TABLE understanding_summary (
    summary_id PRIMARY KEY,
    class_id FOREIGN KEY,
    average_understanding,
    total_responses,
    generated_at
);
